### Using a Wireless Router

   - Set the **SSID** as specified in the quiz.
   - Select **WPA2-PSK** for authentication (if required in the quiz).
   - Enter the **password** as given in the quiz.
3. In the **GUI Configuration** section, modify:
   - **Router IP**
   - **Start IP**
   - **Maximum users**
   	 *(Follow the quiz instructions for these values.)*
4. On the PC:
   - Go to **Config** â†’ **Wireless**.
   - Set the **SSID** and **password** to match the router settings.
5. In **Config**, change **DHCP â†’ Static â†’ DHCP** to request an IP address.

### Using an Access Point & Switch *(Likely to be in the quiz!)*

## DHCP Server Configuration

1. Open the **DHCP Server**, then:
   - Assign an IP in the **Desktop** section.
   - If connecting multiple divisions, configure each separately based on their respective port (e.g., Finance on **FastEthernet0** â†’ Set **FastEthernet0 IP** as labeled on the switch connection).
2. In the **Services** tab, go to **DHCP**:
   - Select the correct **interface** (e.g., Finance Division â†’ **FastEthernet0**).
   - Enter the **Default Gateway**, **Start IP**, **Subnet Mask**, and **Maximum Users**.
   - Turn **DHCP On** by clicking the toggle.
